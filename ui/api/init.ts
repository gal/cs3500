/*
    Here you will define a generic funtion to make fetch requests using
    request and access tokens, then you will export abstracted functions
    to manipulate the api

    PS. tokens are to be stored in localstorage. you will need to wrap
    your generic function to handle errors -> ie. access token invalid ->
    fetch new one with request token.
